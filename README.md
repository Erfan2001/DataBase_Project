# Database Project

 Normalization Art Gallery Database

## Project description:

The diagram below illustrates the structural layout of an art gallery, comprising various tables, each with specified relationships between them.

1) Based on the observed tables, perform the necessary normalization up to the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) level if required. Subsequently, implement the resulting tables using SQL.

2) While preparing the project report, ensure to capture screenshots of the SQL code and the tables created within the software. Include these images alongside comprehensive explanations within the report file.

3) If a table no longer requires further normalization, provide a clear rationale for concluding the normalization process for that specific table.

* The underlined attributes represent the primary keys within the table.
* Attributes highlighted in purple denote foreign keys.
